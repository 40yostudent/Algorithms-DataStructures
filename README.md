# Algorithms and Data Structures in Swift

## Description

An opinionated project about how to implement some important Algorithms and Data Structures in Swift, written for humans, not processors (should compile eventually). Released for public domain and made for educational academic purposes.
Every topic has its own target folder and an Xcode Playground included as executable documentation. Also, documentation is provided md-formatted in every file where it makes sense, as well as tests for every testable entity.

### Works with

* Swift 5.3 and above
* untested in Linux (will test it)

## Workplan (more to be added)

* Algorithms
  * Mergesort
  * Quicksort
  * Heapsort
* Data Structures
  * Stack
  * Queue
  * Linked List
  * Binary Search Tree
  * Heap (if an array-based data structure can make sense in Swift)

## Aknowledgements

Before enrolling at [University of Milano Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it), I've been a self-taught developer for nearly 10 years, left behind loads of important topics just because they didn't "click" in my head, and piled up a huge amount of technical debt. This project, still in the very early stage of development, is a tribute to the *Algorithms and Data Structure* course mantained by [Prof. Claudio Zandron](https://en.unimib.it/claudio-zandron) whose commitment, passion and dedication led me to start to grasp the real meaning of code and programming choices, and gave me the required tools to understand this important matter.
I have had this project in mind for a long time, since I discovered the great [basecs series](https://medium.com/basecs) by [Vaidehi Joshi](https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi) and now, at last, I feel like I can dedicate myself to the subject with less fear and more and more enjoyment.
